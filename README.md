# NPM Stream Maker

NPM Stream Maker is a control panel and automation toolkit for managing Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) streams, port scanning, and cleaning up proxy hosts. It is designed to simplify the process of extracting ports from AMP templates, generating stream configurations, and maintaining your NPM setup.

## Features

- **Port Scanner**: Automatically clones AMPTemplates, scans for port definitions, and generates a port list in OPNsense-compatible range format.
- **Stream Generator**: Generates and synchronizes stream and websocket configurations for NPM.
- **NPM Cleaner**: Deletes all streams and proxy hosts in NPM, leaving it completely clean to start from scratch.
- **NPM Bootstrap**: If Nginx Proxy Manager is not detected, generates a ready-to-use `docker-compose.yml` for quick deployment.

## WebSocket Integration

NPM Stream Maker includes a WebSocket server (`ws_server.py`) and client (`ws_client.py`) to enable dynamic and automated updates of stream and websocket configurations in Nginx Proxy Manager.

- **ws_server.py**: Runs on the NPM host and listens for WebSocket connections. It receives port and IP information from clients and updates the NPM database accordingly. It can also detect WireGuard peers and update forwarding rules dynamically.
- **ws_client.py**: Runs on remote hosts. It detects which ports are listening locally, and sends their IP and port information to the WebSocket server. Only ports listed in `ports.txt` are sent.

**How it works:**
1. The client scans for listening ports and sends their IP/port to the server via WebSocket.
2. The server receives the data, validates the token, and updates the forwarding IP for the specified port in the NPM database.
3. If WireGuard is used, the server can auto-detect the correct peer IP for forwarding.
4. This allows for automated, real-time updates of NPM stream and websocket rules as services come online or change IP.

**Security:**  
A token is required for authentication. The token can be set via the `.wstoken` file or generated by the server. This ensures that only authorized clients can update the NPM configuration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [rich](https://pypi.org/project/rich/) Python package
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository or copy the project files.**

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure required system commands are installed:**
   - `git`
   - `docker`
   - `docker-compose`
   - `python3`

   If any are missing, the control panel will provide installation tips.

## Usage

1. **Run the Control Panel:**
   ```bash
   python3 Control_Panel.py
   ```

2. **Follow the menu:**
   - **Port Scanner**: Scans AMPTemplates for ports and generates a `ports.txt` file.
   - **Stream Generator**: Generates and synchronizes NPM stream and websocket configs.
   - **NPM Cleaner**: Deletes all streams and proxy hosts in NPM (WARNING: leaves NPM empty).
   - **Exit**: Closes the control panel.

3. **First-time NPM setup:**
   - If Nginx Proxy Manager is not detected, a basic `docker-compose.yml` will be created in the `npm` directory.
   - To start NPM:
     ```bash
     cd npm
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

## Notes

- The Port Scanner clones the [AMPTemplates](https://github.com/CubeCoders/AMPTemplates) repository each run and deletes it after extracting ports.
- All output and progress is shown using rich terminal formatting.
- The Stream Generator supports both stream and websocket configuration generation and synchronization.
- The NPM Cleaner script will remove **all** streams and proxy hosts from NPM, leaving it empty for a fresh start.
- This project is intended for advanced users familiar with Docker and Nginx Proxy Manager.
